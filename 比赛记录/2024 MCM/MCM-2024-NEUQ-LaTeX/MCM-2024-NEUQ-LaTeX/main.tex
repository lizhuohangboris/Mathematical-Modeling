%%%%%Summary Sheet内容
\begin{summary}

 The summary is an essential part of your MCM/ICM paper and should appear as the first page of your solution report. The judges place considerable weight on the summary, and winning papers are often distinguished from other papers based on the quality of the summary.

 \begin{itemize}
   \item To write a good summary, imagine that a reader will choose whether to read the body of the paper based on your summary: Your concise presentation in the summary should inspire a reader to learn about the details of your work.
   \item You should write the summary last, as it should clearly describe your approach to the problem and, most prominently, your most important conclusions. Ensure you plan time after solving your problem to write a comprehensive and articulate summary.
   \item Summaries that are mere restatements of the contest problem, or are a cut-and-paste boilerplate from the Introduction are generally considered to be weak.
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}



\subsection{Data Preprocessing}



\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}
1. Clearly indicate the use of LLMs or other AI tools in their report, including which model was used and for what purpose. Please use inline citations and the reference section. Also append the Report on Use of AI (described below) after your 25-page solution.\\
2. Verify the accuracy, validity, and appropriateness of the content and any citations generated by language models and correct any errors or inconsistencies.\\
3. Provide citation and references, following guidance provided here. Double-check citations to ensure they are accurate and are properly referenced.\\
4. Be conscious of the potential for plagiarism since LLMs may reproduce substantial text from other sources. Check the original sources to be sure you are not plagiarizing someone else's work.


\begin{Theorem} \label{thm:freeLunch}
No free lunch.
\end{Theorem}

In mathematical folklore, the "no free lunch" (NFL) theorem (sometimes pluralized) of
David Wolpert and William Macready
appears in the 1997 "No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization" \cite{Wolpert1997}.
Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for machine learning (statistical inference)
\cite{Wolpert1996}.

\begin{Lemma}[Moore's Law]\label{thm:mooreLaw}
Processor speeds, or overall processing power for computers will double every two years.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
Moore's law is a 1965 observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore
that the number of transistors placed in an integrated circuit (IC)
or chip doubles approximately every two years.
Because Moore's observation has been frequently cited and
used for research and development by multiple organizations,
and it has been proven repeatedly, it is known as Moore's law.

It follows that
\begin{equation}\label{equ:aa}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}

Include your model design and justification for type model used or developed.

Calculating and simplifying the model:
\[
\frac{\diff y}{\diff x} = f(x)g(y)
\]

\section{Machine Learning Methods for Classification}

The equation \eqref{equ:aa} has told that

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
  a_{11}  & a_{12}  & a_{13}   \\
  a_{21}  & a_{22}  & a_{23}   \\
  a_{31}  & a_{32}  & a_{33}
\end{pmatrix}
= \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}\cos^{-1} \theta \arcsin \theta
\]

\[
p_{j}=
\begin{cases}
0,             & \text{if $j$ is odd}\\
r!\,(-1)^{j/2},& \text{if $j$ is even}
\end{cases}
\]

\[
\arcsin \theta  = \oint\limits_\varphi \lim_{x \to \infty } \frac{n!}{r! (n - r)!} %\eqno (23)
\]

The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution,
would be the most important continuous distribution.
For $-\infty < \mu < +\infty$ and $\sigma > 0$,
the normal distribution is denoted by $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$,
and its probability density is given by
\[
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \exp \left\{ -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right\}.
\]
The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of a normal variable $X$ is written by
\[
F(x) = P(X \le x) = \int_{-\infty} ^x f(t) \diff t
= \int_{-\infty} ^x  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma}
  \me^{-\frac{(t - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \diff t,
\]
denoted by $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ with probability density function (pdf)
$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \me^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}$.

The frequency property of a controlled system is analyzed  via
\[
G(\mi \omega) = G(s)\Big|_{s = \mi \omega}  = A(\omega) \me^{\mi \phi(\omega)}= U(\omega) + \mi V(\omega).
\]


\section{Simulation Result and Model evaluation}

Describe model testing and sensitivity analysis, including error analysis, etc.

\section*{\center{Report on Use of AI}}
Think carefully about how to document and reference whatever tools the team may choose to use. A variety of style guides are beginning to incorporate policies for the citation and referencing of AI tools. Use inline citations and list all AI tools used in the reference section of your 25-page solution.
Whether or not a team chooses to use AI tools, the main solution report is still limited to 25 pages. If a team chooses to utilize AI, following the end of your report, add a new section titled Report on Use of AI. This new section has no page limit and will not be counted as part of the 25-page solution.
Examples (this is not exhaustive these examples to your situation):\\

1. OpenAI ChatGPT (Jan 8, 2024 version, ChatGPT-4,) \\
Query1: <insert the exact wording you input into the AI tool> \\
Output1: <insert the complete output from the AI tool>\\
Query2: <insert the exact wording you input into the AI tool> \\
Output2: <insert the complete output from the AI tool>\\

2. OpenAI Ernie (Jan 8, 2024 version, Ernie 4.0) \\
Query: <insert the exact wording of any subsequent input into the AI tool> \\
Output: <insert the complete output from the second query>\\

3. Github CoPilot (Jan 8, 2024 version) \\
Query: <insert the exact wording you input into the AI tool> \\
Output: <insert the complete output from the AI tool>\\

4. Google Bard (Jan 9, 2024 version) \\
Query: <insert the exact wording of your query> \\
Output: <insert the complete output from the AI tool>\\
